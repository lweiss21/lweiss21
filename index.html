    <p> RIP CITY</p>
    <p> Last game recap:</p>
    <p>The blazers lots to the grizzlies. C.J played really well putting up 36 points on 14 of 36 from the field. He also had 3 steals. Nurkic only had 6 points and 5 boards becuase he was limited due to foul trouble. Very rough game for dame putting up just 12 points on 4 of 16 from the field. Dame also had 5 boards and 6 assists. Vonleh contributed with 10 boards. The blazers actually played pretty good defense in the game but the offense just was not there. The blazers only lost by 1 with a final score of 97-98.  </p>

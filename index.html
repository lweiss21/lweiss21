    <p> LET'S GO RIP CITY</p>
    <p> Last game recap:</p>
    <p>The Blazers took a loss to the Toronto Raptors. It was a tough loss. They did not play to well and Damian Lillard led their scoring putting up 36 points and going 12 of his 23 shots from the field. It was a rough game for C.J putting up only 16 points and going 5 for 16 from the field. Nurkic also had a pretty rough game with 8 points, 6 rebounds, and a block. The blazers should be able to bounce back with their next game in Utah</p>
